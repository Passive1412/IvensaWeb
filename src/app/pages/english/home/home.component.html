          <p>
            At Ivensa we believe that technology and data can improve lives.
            Many firms are stuck in old paradigms not utilizing the endless
            possibilities that new technology provides. We are here to change
            that. We focus on physical retail stores where firms are struggling
            to keep up with online shopping, but our journey does not stop here.
            We are enthusiastic about how technology shape businesses and we are
            excited to bring new technologies to firms and help them optimize in
            ways they never thought possible. We are just getting started but
            canâ€™t wait to set our footprint in this world.
